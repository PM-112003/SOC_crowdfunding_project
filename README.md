2. Learned to create and set up my metamask account and sepoliaEth with some help from my mentor (2-3 days)
3. Then learned about solidity programming from resources provided and practiced by building some simple smart contracts to get comfortable with the language and RemixIDE (10 days)
4. Started with my crowdfunding project, struggled a lot with use of payable and but finally completed the project. (12 days)

**Things Learned**
